        <p>Steve Harrington is a fictional character from the Netflix television show Stranger Things, portrayed by Joe Keery. While starting out as a typical unlikable jock, Steve has grown into a more protecting and caring character as the show has progressed, a development that has received widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike and has led to him becoming one of the showâ€™s most beloved and enduring characters.[1] Initially a part of the recurring cast, Keery was promoted to the main cast in the second season. Steve is a side antagonist turned protagonist at the end of season 1, and one of the main protagonists of season 2, season 3, and season 4.</p>
